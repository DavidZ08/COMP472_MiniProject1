(a)
This task consisted in training several Naive-Bayes classifiers on a collection of BBC articles tha can be categorized 
in the following categories: business, entertainement, politics, sport and tech. Based on the bar graph realized in step 2
of this assignment, I believe the best metric suited to this task would be the category "sports" as it contains the most 
files associated to it compared to other categories. That means the Naive-Bayes classifiers, because they are more exposed
to sports-type articles, they will be able to identify them with more success than other metrics.

(b)
There are no differences between step 7 and step 8 (where we create two Naive-Bayes classifiers and use the default
parameters for each of them) because we change nothing between the two classifiers: they use the same value for smoothing.
This is important because, we can observe changes between step 7, step 9 and step 10 because of the differences 
between the three smoothing values used for the three classfiers (step 7 = default, step 9 = 0.0001 and step 10 = 0.9).
The changes between the classifiers can be more clearly observed in the confusion matrices for each step;
some values increase, some decrease.
