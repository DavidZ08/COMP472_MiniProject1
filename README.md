Instructions to run Task #1:

5. Finally, to run the program, either press the "play" icon on the top right of the window, or right-click on the background of the window and press "Run 'main.py'", or
click on the "play" icon at the left of " if __name__ == '__main__' ".
6. The output files will be located inside the Q1 folder: "BBC-distribution.pdf", "bbc-discussion.txt" and "bbc-performance.txt"
